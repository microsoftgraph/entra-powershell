# Remove-EntraDeletedDirectoryObject

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Remove-EntraDeletedDirectoryObject

## DESCRIPTION

The `Remove-EntraDeletedDirectoryObject` cmdlet is used to permanently delete a previously deleted directory object.

When a directory object is permanently deleted, it can no longer be restored.

For delegated scenarios, the calling user needs to have at least one of the following Microsoft Entra roles.

- To permanently delete deleted applications or service principals: `Application Administrator`, `Cloud Application Administrator`, or `Hybrid Identity Administrator`.
- To permanently delete deleted users: `User Administrator`.
- To permanently delete deleted groups: `Groups Administrator`.

Remove-EntraDeletedDirectoryObject -DirectoryObjectId $deletedApplication.Id
