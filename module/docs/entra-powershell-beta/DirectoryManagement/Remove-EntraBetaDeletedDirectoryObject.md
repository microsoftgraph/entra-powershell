## DESCRIPTION

The `Remove-EntraBetaDeletedDirectoryObject` cmdlet is used to permanently delete a previously deleted directory object.

When a directory object is permanently deleted, it can no longer be restored.

For delegated scenarios, the calling user needs to have at least one of the following Microsoft Entra roles.

- To permanently delete applications or service principals: `Application Administrator`, `Cloud Application Administrator`, or `Hybrid Identity Administrator`.
- To permanently delete users: `User Administrator`.
- To permanently delete groups: `Groups Administrator`.

Remove-EntraBetaDeletedDirectoryObject -DirectoryObjectId $deletedApplication.Id
