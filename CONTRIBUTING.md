# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first open an issue describing the update you wish to make and read over our guidelines.

There are a few different recommended paths to get contributions into the released version.

## Filing Issues

The best way to get started with a contribution is to start a dialog with us. Sometimes, features will be under development or out of scope for this module, and it's best to check before starting work on contribution, especially for large work items.

## Improving Commands

This module provides a customization logic that helps us to manually improve the autogenerated code, adding missing Commands, missing parameters on Commands, and missing output values. Please check the customization guidelines.
