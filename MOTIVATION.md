# Introduction

We created the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module to simplify complex tasks, enhance usability, and boost productivity. Our motivation also comes from the collaborative nature of the PowerShell community. We believe that your contributions can help others, creating a shared ecosystem of knowledge and growth. We invite you to join us in the innovative journey.

## Microsoft Graph PowerShell ❤️ Microsoft Entra PowerShell

Microsoft Entra PowerShell is a part of our increased investment in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. It brings high-quality and scenario-optimized Entra resource management to the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. Still, it keeps all the benefits of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK for authorization, connection management, error handling, and (low-level) API coverage. As Microsoft Entra PowerShell builds on the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, it's interoperable.

## Benefits of Microsoft Entra PowerShell

- **Focus on usability**: Microsoft Entra PowerShell offers human-readable parameters, deliberate parameter set specification, inline documentation, and core PowerShell fundamentals like pipelining.

- **Backward compatibility with AzureAD PowerShell module**: Microsoft Entra PowerShell simplifies migration from the [retiring AzureAD PowerShell module][azureADRetirement].

- **Flexible and granular authorization**: Consistent with Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, Microsoft Entra PowerShell enables administrative consent for the permissions you want to grant to the application. It also supports running Microsoft Entra PowerShell using your own service principal or user-assigned managed identity.

- **Open source**: The Microsoft Entra PowerShell module is open source, enabling community collaboration to enhance PowerShell and share innovations. You can explore Microsoft's customizations and adapt them to your needs.

### When to use which PowerShell module

Here's a guide outlining the two modules. They target different levels of usability.

| Area         | Microsoft Graph PowerShell | Microsoft Entra PowerShell  |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Use case**  | Low-level, flexible       | Scenario-based            |
| **Usability** | Developer-focused        | IT Pro-focused            |
| **Freshness** | Always current           | Follows Microsoft Graph releases |
| **Coverage**  | Comprehensive, across Graph | Microsoft Entra resources |
| **Generation** | Autogenerated            | Human-authored            |

### Putting you in the driver's seat

With the repository being public, you can examine the Microsoft Entra PowerShell commands to view any custom logic, the underlying Microsoft Graph SDK, or APIs. It gives you the flexibility to customize the commands further if needed. We highly encourage you and the community to provide feedback on scenarios and use cases to help us improve the Microsoft Entra module. For example, you can suggest new parameter sets, new commands, documentation improvements, or new logic to assist others on a larger scale.

### Accelerating migration from legacy modules

The module also offers significant (over _98%_) compatibility  with the [retiring AzureAD module][azureADRetirement] to accelerate migration.
