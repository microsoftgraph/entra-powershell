# Introduction

We created the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module to simplify complex tasks, enhance usability, and boost productivity. Our motivation also comes from the collaborative nature of the PowerShell community. We believe that your contributions can help others, creating a shared ecosystem of knowledge and growth. We invite you to join us in this innovative journey.

## Microsoft Graph PowerShell ❤️ Microsoft Entra PowerShell

Microsoft Entra PowerShell is a part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell solution. It doesn't compete with what you use in Microsoft Graph PowerShell - you don't need to switch again. Both modules work well together. Microsoft Entra PowerShell helps to improve Microsoft Graph PowerShell, with good cmdlet specifications, but it keeps all the benefits of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK for authorization, connection management, error handling, and (low-level) API coverage.

### When to use which PowerShell module

Here's a guide outlining the two modules. They target different levels of usability.

| Area  | Microsoft Graph PowerShell | Microsoft Entra PowerShell |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Use case  | low-level, flexibility  | scenario-based |
| Usability  | developer focused  | IT Pro focused |
| Freshness  | always-current  | Follows Microsoft Graph releases |
| Coverage  | comprehensive, across Graph  | Microsoft Entra resources |
| Generation  | autogenerated  | human-authored |

### Continued investments

We commit to continue investing in improving the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, from documentation, tooling, capabilities support, new features etc.

### Putting you in the driver's seat

You're able crack open the Microsoft Entra PowerShell commands to see any custom logic, the underlying Microsoft Graph SDK or APIs and give you flexibility if they want further customization. We highly encourage you and the community to give us feedback on scenarios and use cases to help us improve the Microsoft Entra module. For example, you can suggest a new parameter set, a new command, documentation improvements, and new logic to help others at scale.

### Accelerating migration from legacy modules

Microsoft Entra PowerShell module provides significant compatibility with the legacy modules, which can accelerate migration for customers still using legacy modules that will due for deprecation. Whereas some of our customers have already migrated, most customers are yet to migrate. You can help us validate and test the module with your legacy scripts. We value your feedback.
