# Introduction

Our motivation to create the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module stems from a hunger for improvement, a drive to simplify complexity, and the ambition to foster usability and productivity.

This motivation also springs from the collaborative spirit within the PowerShell community. We know that your contribution has the potential to benefit others, fostering an ecosystem of shared knowledge and mutual growth. We're creating a canvas awaiting the strokes of innovation from the community. We welcome you to have a seat at the table.

## Microsoft Graph PowerShell ❤️ Microsoft Entra PowerShell

Microsoft Entra PowerShell is a part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell solution. It doesn't compete with what you use in Microsoft Graph PowerShell - you don't need to switch again. Both modules work well together. Microsoft Entra PowerShell helps to improve Microsoft Graph PowerShell, with good cmdlet specifications, but it keeps all the benefits of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK for authorization, connection management, error handling, and (low-level) API coverage.

### When to use which PowerShell module

Here's a guide outlining the two modules. They target different levels of usability.

| Area  | Microsoft Graph PowerShell | Microsoft Entra PowerShell |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Use case  | low-level, flexibility  | scenario-based |
| Usability  | less usable  | gold-standard |
| Freshness  | always-current  | slow-to-update |
| Coverage  | comprehensive, across Graph  | Microsoft Entra resources |
| Generation  | autogenerated  | human-authored |

### Continued investments

We commit to continue investing in improving the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, from documentation, tooling, capabilities support, new features etc.

### Putting you in the driver's seat

You're able crack open the Microsoft Entra PowerShell commands to see any custom logic, the underlying Microsoft Graph SDK or APIs and give you flexibility if they want further customization. We highly encourage you and the community to give us feedback on scenarios and use cases to help us improve the Microsoft Entra module. For example, you can suggest a new parameter set, a new command, documentation improvements, and new logic to help others at scale.

### Accelerating migration from legacy modules

Microsoft Entra PowerShell module provides significant compatibility with the legacy modules, which can accelerate migration for customers still using legacy modules that will due for deprecation. Whereas some of our customers have already migrated, most customers are yet to migrate. You can help us validate and test the module with your legacy scripts. We value your feedback.
