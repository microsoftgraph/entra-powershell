# Microsoft Entra PowerShell

The Microsoft Entra PowerShell is a collection of cmdlets that helps access Microsoft Entra resources using the [Microsoft Graph SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell). The module primarily functions as a usability layer with human-readable parameters, deliberate parameter set specification, inline documentation, and core PowerShell fundamentals like pipelining.

While the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module provides significant compatibility with the legacy modules (such as Azure AD PowerShell), that can accelerate migration to Microsoft Graph as a significant benefit, the Microsoft Entra module remains as a long-term, perpetual product offering.
