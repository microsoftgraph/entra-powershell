<br>Microsoft Entra PowerShell<br>
</h1>

The Microsoft Entra PowerShell is a collection of cmdlets that helps access Entra resources using Microsoft Graph. The Microsoft Entra module can also help emulate the legacy Azure AD, Azure AD preview, and selected MSOnline PowerShell cmdlets. This module uses [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell) to make calls to [Microsoft Graph](http://microsoft.graph.com). The Microsoft Entra is designed with usability in mind to provide you with a rich experience.

This module provides AzureAD PowerShell users a tool to support their migration to the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. The Microsoft Entra "adapter" cmdlets have different names to those of the Azure AD PowerShell to avoid name collisions.

**This module is under development. It is NOT READY for Production environments.**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

This module depends on the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell#readme). Some modules will need to be installed for this module to work. Please check the prerequisites [here](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/entra-powershell/blob/main/PREREQUISITE.md).

### Local Build

Please refer to [local building and installing guide](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/entra-powershell/blob/main/build/BUILD.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Entra PowerShell module will be published on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph.Entra) post-private preview stage. Kindly use the "Local Build" option in the interim.

## Microsoft Entra PowerShell Usage

1. Importing the module
```powershell
Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Entra -Force
```

2. Authentication

To see all the possible options please refer to [MS Graph SDK authentication](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell/blob/dev/README.md#usage).
```powershell
 Connect-MgGraph
```

3. Using commands

Here's an example that will emulate the Azure AD module's Get-AzureADUser with a Microsoft Graph call:

```powershell
Get-EntraUser -SearchString "Joe" 
```

This example gives you more insight into the calls being made:

```powershell
Get-EntraUser -SearchString "Joe" -Debug
```

4. Aliasing Azure AD Commands

Running this cmdlet creates aliases for all of the supported Azure AD cmdlets to those in the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module:

```powershell
Set-EntraAzureADAliases
```

This will show you all of the newly created aliases:

```powershell
Get-Alias -Name *AzureAd*
```

You can now run the Azure AD cmdlet using an alias, which calls the Microsoft Graph PowerShell under the hood.

```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -SearchString "Jane" 
```

This example gives you more insight into the calls being made:

```powershell
Get-AzureADUser -SearchString "Jane" -Debug
```

**NB - removing the AzureAD module, if installed, is recommended to avoid collisions.**

```powershell
Remove-Module AzureAD
```

5. Running a script with the adapter

You can use the Microsoft Entra PowerShell to test an AzureAD PowerShell module-based script. This will help determine if a script can be migrated to the MS Graph PowerShell SDK. 

```powershell
Test-EntraScript -Script .\Export_secrets_and_certificates_for_app_registrations.ps1
```

If the script is compatible, you won't see any output, although you can use `$?` to display that True was returned. If the script isn't compatible, you will see a warning with details of the problem cmdlet(s). Example:

```powershell
Test-EntraScript -Script .\Export_secrets_and_certificates_for_app_registrations.ps1

WARNING: Command Get-AzureADApplicationKeyCredential is not supported
WARNING: Script contains commands that are not supported by the compatibility adapter.
```
